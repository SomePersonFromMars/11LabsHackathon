# Problem Statement
You are given a sorted array of integers and a target integer. Your task is to implement a binary search algorithm to determine if the target integer exists in the array. If the target exists, return its index; otherwise, return -1.

# Input:
An integer `n` (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^6): the number of elements in the array.
An array of `n` sorted integers (each integer can be between -10^9 and 10^9).
An integer `target`: the integer to search for in the array.

# Output:
An integer: the index of the target in the array if found; otherwise, return -1.
