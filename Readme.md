# TAilentSeeker
If you are reading this our journey might have finished... Nonethless WE PRESENTLY PRESENT TO YOU. Our newborn child `TAilentSeeker`. 
Problem, solution and demo can be found somewhere else so here we will focus on technical stuff. 

# Running
Project is powered by docker but unfortunately you are unable to run it out of the box 🙁.

## Steps for getting the app running
Main issue is our ElevenLabs ConversionalAi workaround. We are using ngrok for tuneling localhost endpoints to allow ElevenLabs Api to use webhooks.
For full experience you need to:
- configure webhooks on ElevenLabs dashboard
- run docker-compose
- run ngrok locally
- enjoy 😄

> if u plan to use hosted one pls use it one at a time this tool is just a PoC and was not prepered for few parallel connections
